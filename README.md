# Pomodoro-Technique-Timer

**This is a fancy timer for the adepts of the Pomodoro Technique.
It will divide your time in 25-min work periods, followed by 5-min break periods.
After four work periods, you'll get a long 20-min break.
For each work period you'll see a green checkmark below, to keep track of your work time.**
